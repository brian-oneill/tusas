Building and Running Tusas with CMake

Building Tusas

Here, we are inside the trunk directory. As you enter the CMake command to build the tusas executable, the path to your Trilinos download must be saved as a variable TRILINOS_DIR, shown below.

$ cmake -DTRILINOS_DIR:string=/Users/ameliajo/Documents/Trilinos/trilinos-11.12.1-Source/GCC_4_9_2_MPI_OMP_OPT/ .
$ make


If any mistakes are made with this CMake command, make sure to delete CMakeCache.txt, CMakeFiles, Makefile, and cmake_install.cmake, to be sure that the corrected commands may go through properly.

Edit
Running tusas

From inside the trunk directory where Tusas is built, you can run the tusas executable that was just built with CMake. Note that the input file tusas.xml can be altered to preference.

$ ./tusas --input-file=tusas.xml

For clang may need:
install_name_tool -add_rpath /usr/local/llvm/10.0.0/lib/ /Users/cnewman/work/tusas_git/fix/pfhub2T/../../VOTD_CLANG_KOKKOS/tusas
